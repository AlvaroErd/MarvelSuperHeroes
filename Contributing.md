## Hi! ü§ó
First off, thank you for considering contributing to my project! It¬¥s because of people like you that the Android community advances and improves as a free software.

## About this project
This repo is an open source project and we love to receive contributions from our community ‚Äî you! There are many ways to contribute, from writing tutorials or blog posts, improving the documentation, submitting bug reports and feature requests or writing code which can be incorporated into the project itself.

## How to contribute
We'd love to accept your patches and contributions to this project. There are just a few small guidelines you need to follow.

## Guidelines
Following these guidelines helps to communicate that you respect the time of the developers managing and developing this open source project. In return, they should reciprocate that respect in addressing your issue, assessing changes, and helping you finalize your pull requests.

- Ensure that you have been check compatibility for the mayority of screen sizes and Android Sdk versions on every change that you request it.
- Create issues for any major changes and enhancements that you wish to make. Discuss things transparently and get community feedback.
- Keep feature versions as small as possible, preferably one new feature per version.
- Be welcoming to newcomers and encourage diverse new contributors from all backgrounds.

## First time?
Working on your first Pull Request? You can learn how from this free series, [How to Contribute to an Open Source Project on GitHub](https://egghead.io/series/how-to-contribute-to-an-open-source-project-on-github).
At this point, you're ready to make your changes! Feel free to ask for help; everyone is a beginner at first
If a maintainer asks you to "rebase" your PR, they're saying that a lot of code has changed, and that you need to update your branch so it's easier to merge.

## Preparing a pull request for review
Ensure your change is properly formatted by running:

```gradle
./gradlew spotlessApply
```

Please correct any failures before requesting a review.

## Getting started
For something that is bigger than a one or two line fix:

1. Create your own fork of the code
2. Do the changes in your fork
3. If you like the change and think the project could use it:
    * Be sure you have followed the code style for the project.
    * Send a pull request.


Small contributions such as fixing spelling errors, where the content is small enough to not be considered intellectual property, can be submitted by a contributor as a patch, without a CLA.
As a rule of thumb, changes are obvious fixes if they do not introduce any new functionality or creative thinking. As long as the change does not affect functionality, some likely examples include the following:

Spelling / grammar fixes
Typo correction, white space and formatting changes
Comment clean up
Bug fixes that change default return values or error codes stored in constants
Adding logging messages or debugging output
Changes to ‚Äòmetadata‚Äô files like Gemfile, .gitignore, build scripts, etc.
Moving source files from one directory or package to another

## Bugs
When filing an issue, make sure to answer these five questions:

1. What version of Android are you using (also what mobile phone are you using)?
2. What did you do?
3. What did you expect to see?
4. What did you see instead?

If you find a security vulnerability, do NOT open an issue. Email me instead (email is on my profile).

## New features
If you find yourself wishing for a feature that doesn't exist in this project, you are probably not alone. There are bound to be others out there with similar needs. Many of the features that my project has today have been added because our users saw the need. Open an issue on my issues list on GitHub which describes the feature you would like to see, why you need it, and how it should work.

## Code reviews
All submissions, including submissions by project members, require review. We use GitHub pull requests for this purpose. Consult [GitHub Help](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/about-pull-requests) for more information on using pull requests.

### But most important thing... thank you for your time and your interest in making this application level up üôè
